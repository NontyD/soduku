        <h1>About the Game</h1>
        <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle that has captivated enthusiasts worldwide. The name "Sudoku" comes from
            the Japanese phrase "Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru," meaning "the digits must remain single," but the game
            isn't originally Japanese.</p>

        <p>Its origins trace back to the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who created "Latin Squares," a
            game involving non-repeating numbers in rows and columns. In 1979, American puzzle creator Howard Garns
            developed a modern version called "Number Place."</p>

        <p>Sudoku gained global fame in 1984 when the Japanese publisher Nikoli introduced it, adding small
            modifications. By the early 2000s, it became a worldwide phenomenon, appearing in newspapers and puzzle
            books.</p>

        <p> Today, Sudoku remains a beloved puzzle game. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid so that every row, column, and
            3x3 section contains the digits 1 to 9 without repetition. The game relies on logic and deduction, offering
            a timeless challenge for all ages.</p>

        <h1>Sudoku Rules</h1>
        <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits. The grid is divided
            into rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids, and the puzzle provides a few numbers as clues. Your task is to
            complete the grid by following these rules:</p>


        <p>Objective:</strong> is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that:</p>

        <p>Each row contains the digits 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers.<br>
            Each column contains the digits 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers.<br>
            Each 3x3 subgrid (also called "box") contains the digits 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers.</P>
