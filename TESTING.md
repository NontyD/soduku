## AUTOMATED TESTING

Testing was conducted continuously throughout the build process. I used Chrome Developer Tools to identify and resolve issues in real-time as I developed. Additionally, I utilized Google Developer Tools to verify that everything was functioning correctly and to troubleshoot any unexpected behavior. To ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices, I also employed both Google Chrome Developer Tools and Firefox Inspector.

### Browser Compatibility

The website was tested on these browsers and nothing unexpected happened:
